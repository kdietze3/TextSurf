This file is not just a readme.txt. It is also a brainstorming area.

Text Surf for Android
Text Browser for Android 2.2+
Created by Kevin Dietze

Eventually the goal is to have a working web browser for users that are on slower edge networks or are just trying to save bandwidth.

Features that are working
Nothing really (At this points its a crappy webview)

Features that are coming.
Tabs
Bookmarks (Maybe branded as TextMarks?)
Textify images (Send command to remote server, server grabs image, server does the heavy lifting, beams down text version)
